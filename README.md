# New colormaps from Matplotlib converted for Gnuplot

It includes four colormaps: viridis, plasma, inferno and magma. Examples of these colormaps can be seen [here](https://bids.github.io/colormap/). You can use them in gnuplot by adding the following line to your script:

    load 'plasma.plt'

Replace `plasma.plt` with desired colormap.

Original colormaps are designed by Nathaniel J. Smith, Stefan van der Walt and Eric Firing, licensed under CC0. `colormap.py` is a fragment of [this file](https://github.com/BIDS/colormap/blob/master/colormaps.py).
